<p>
<b>Networking</b> <br>

Create an application where clients connect to a server in order to form a <i>social network</i>.
The application will contain two modules (create a project for each one):
<ul>
<li>The <b>server</b> is responsible with the management of the clients and the implementation of the services.
<li>The <b>client</b> will communicate with the server, sending it <i>commands</i> containing the name of the service and the required parameters. The commands are:
	<ul>
	<li> register <i>name</i>: adds a new person to the social network;
	<li> login <i>name</i>: establishes a connection between the server and the client;
	<li> friend <i>name<sub>1</sub> name<sub>2</sub> ... name<sub>k</sub></i>: adds friendship relations between the person that sends the command and other persons;
	<li> send <i>message</i>: sends a message to all friends.
	<li> read: reads the messages from the server.
	</ul> 
</ul>

<p>
The main specifications of the application are:
<hr>
<p><b>Compulsory</b> (1p)

<ul>
<li> <b>Create the project ServerApplication</b>. This will contain (at least) the classes: <i>SocialNetworkServer</i> and <i>ClientThread</i>.
<li> Create the class <i>SocialNetworkServer</i>. An instance of this class will create a <i>ServerSocket</i> running at a specified port.
The server will receive requests (commands) from clients and it will execute them. 
<pre>
public class SocialNetworkServer {
    private static final int PORT = 8100;
    private ServerSocket serverSocket;
    private boolean running = false;

    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        SocialNetworkServer server = new SocialNetworkServer();
        server.init();
        server.waitForClients(); //... handle the exceptions!
    }
    ... // Implement the init() method: create the serverSocket and set running to true
    ... // Implement the waitForClients() method: while running is true, create a new socket for every incoming client and start a ClientThread to execute its request.
	
    public void stop() throws IOException {
        this.running = false;
        serverSocket.close();
    }	
</pre>

<li> Create the class <i>ClientThread</i>. An instance of this class will be responsible with communicating with a client <i>Socket</i>.
<pre>
public class ClientThread extends Thread {
    private Socket socket = null;
    private final GameServer server;
    ... // Create the constructor that receives a reference to the server and to the client socket
    public void run() {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); //client -> server stream
        String request = in.readLine();
        String response = execute(request);
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream()); //server -> client stream
        out.println(response);
        out.flush();
        socket.close(); //... usse try-catch-finally to handle the exceptions!
    }    
    private String execute(String request) {
        ... // display the message: "Server received the request ... "
    }
}
</pre>
<li> <b>Create the project ClientApplication</b>. This will contain (at least) the class: <i>SocialNetworkClient</i>.

<li> Create the class <i>SocialNetworkClient</i>. An instance of this class will read commands from the keyboard and it will send them to the server. The client stops when it reads from the keyboard the string "exit".
<pre>
public class SocialNetworkClient {
    private final static String SERVER_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1";
    private final static int PORT = 8100;
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        SocialNetworkClient client = new SocialNetworkClient();
        while (true) {
            String request = client.readFromKeyboard();
            if (request.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
                break;
            } else {
                client.sendRequestToServer(request);
            }
        }
    }
    ... //Implement the sendRequestToServer method
	
    private String readFromKeyboard() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.next();
    }
}
</pre>
</ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Optional</b> (1p)
<br/>

<ul>
<li> Create the classes <i>Person</i> and <i>SocialNetwork</i> in order to represent the model of the application.
<li> Implement all the commands.
<li> Implement a timeout for a connection (a number of minutes). If the server does not receive any command from a logged in client in the specified period of time, it will terminate the connection.
<li> Implement the command <b>stop</b> in order to "gracefully" stop the server. When the server receives the "stop" command it will not accept new games but it will finish those in progress.
When there are no more games, it will shutdown.
</ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Bonus</b>
<ul>
<li> (1p) Implement an algorithm to determine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_cohesion">structural cohesion</a> of the network. <br/>
<!-- Implementing other non-trivial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis">metrics</a> in order to analyze the social network could bring you additional points. -->

<li> (0.5) Create an HTML file, containing all the persons and their relationships and upload it directly from the application to a Web server. 
You may use <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/"> JCraft </a> for connecting to a server using SFTP and transferring a file (or a similar solution). <br/>
Including a SVG representation of the social network could bring additonal points.
 </ul>
