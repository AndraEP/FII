<p>
<b>Concurrency</b> <br>
Write a program that simulates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_game">positional game</a>, such as the <i>connectivity game</i>, between a given number of players.

<p>
At the beginning of the game the <i>board</i> contains all the edges of a complete graph with <i>n</i> vertices (all the pairs formed with distinct numbers from 1 to <i>n</i>). <br/>
Each player extracts edges successively from the board and must create with them a <i>spanning tree</i> of the initial complete graph.
<br/>
The game ends when either a player makes a spanning tree (in this case the winner receives <i>n</i> points and the others 0) or 
when all edges have been removed from the graph (in this case each player receives a number of points equal to the number of vertices of their largest partial tree).
<br/>
The players might take turns (or not...) and a time limit might be imposed (or not...).

<p>
The main specifications of the application are:
<hr>
<p><b>Compulsory</b> (1p)

<ul>
<li> Create the class <i>Edge</i>. An instance of this class will hold a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to <i>n</i>.
<li> Create the class <i>Graph</i>. A graph will contain a list of edges. 
<li> Create the class <i>Board</i>. An instance of this class will contain at the beginning the complete graph <i>K<sub>n</sub></i>. 
<pre>
public class Board {
    private final Graph complete;
    public Board() { 
        // create the complete graph 
        // shuffle its edges
    }
    public ........... Edge extract() {
        // replace the dots so that the board is thread-safe
        Edge edge = complete.pollFirst();
        return edge;
    }
    public boolean isEmpty() { ... }
}
</pre>


<li> Create the class <i>Player</i>. Each player will have a name and their own instance of a graph object.	
This class will implement the <i>Runnable</i> interface. In the <i>run</i> method the player will repeatedly extract one edge from the board.
<pre>
public class Player implements Runnable {
    ....
    private String name;
    private Game game;
    private Graph graph;	
    ...
    private boolean play() throws InterruptedException {
        Board board = game.getBoard();
        if (board.isEmpty()) { return false; }
        graph.add( board.extract() );
        Thread.sleep(THINKING_TIME); //declare this constant
        if (graph.isSpanningTree()) {
	        game.setWinner(this);
        }
        ...
        return true;
	}
    // implement the run() method, that will repeatedly extract edges
    // implement the toString() method
}
</pre>

<li> Create the <i>Game</i> class. <b>Simulate the game using a thread for each player</b>. <br/>
Pay attention to the <i>synchronization</i> of the threads when extracting edges from the board.

<pre>
public class Game {
    private Board board;
    private final List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    public void addPlayer(Player player) {
        players.add(player);
        player.setGame(this);
    }
    //Create getters and setters
    //Create the method that will start the game: start one thread for each player
}
</pre>

<li>Test the game using a sequence similar with:
<pre>
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.setBoard(new Board(10));
        game.addPlayer(new Player("Player 1"));
        game.addPlayer(new Player("Player 2"));
        game.addPlayer(new Player("Player 3"));
        game.start();
    }
</pre>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><b>Optional</b> (1p)
<br/>
<ul>
<li> Make sure that players wait their turns, using a <i>wait-notify</i> approach.

<li> Implement a <i>timekeeper</i> thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a <i>daemon</i>.
This thread will display the running time of the game and it will stop the game if it exceeds a certain time limit. Try it using larger values for <i>n</i>.

<li> Consider the situation when each player might have a different strategy for extracting a word: automated (random or <b>smart</b>) or manual. <br/>
<i>Player</i> should be an abstract class having as subclasses: <i>RandomPlayer</i>, <i>SmartPlayer</i>, <i>ManualPlayer</i>. <br/>
A "smart" player should try to extend its maximal tree while not allowing others to create a spanning tree. A manual player will use the keyboard.
Implement all three strategies.
<!-- You may also implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker-Breaker_game">Maker-Breaker</a> strategies, for an additional bonus. -->
</ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Bonus</b>
<br/>

<ul>
<li> Consider the situation when other types of positional games should be allowed. <i>Game</i> should be an abstract class.
Implement also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_game">clique game</a>.
<pre>
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        //Game game = new ConnectivityGame();
        Game game = new CliqueGame();
        ...
        game.start();
    }
</pre>	
<b>OR</b>
<li> Create a simple graphical user interface for the game, using Java FX. <br/>
